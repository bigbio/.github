# Welcome to bigbio üëã  

bigbio is an open-source organization dedicated to advancing bioinformatics and computational proteomics and multiomics research. We develop scalable tools, workflows, and libraries to support complex experimental designs in proteomics, genomics and multiomics. Our mission is to empower researchers with accessible, efficient, and cutting-edge solutions for data analysis and integration.

## üåü Key Projects  

### üî¨ Proteomics and Quantitative Analysis  
- **[quantms](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms)**: A comprehensive workflow for proteomics experiments supporting DDA-LFQ, DDA-Isobaric, and DIA-LFQ quantification.  
- **[quantms.io](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.io)**: A proteomics quantification format extending mzTab for large-scale datasets.  
- **[ibaqpy](https://github.com/bigbio/ibaqpy)**: A package for absolute quantification based on the quantms.io format.
- **[quantms.org](https://github.com/bigbio/quantms.org)**: Code for quantms.org, a resource for reanalysis and public proteomics data. 

### üß™ Multiomics and Metadata Tools  
- **[multiomics-configs](https://github.com/bigbio/multiomics-configs)**: Config files for species, taxonomies, and other essential data.  
- **[proteomics-sample-metadata](https://github.com/bigbio/proteomics-sample-metadata)**: A standard for experimental design annotation in proteomics datasets.  
- **[sdrf-pipelines](https://github.com/bigbio/sdrf-pipelines)**: Tools to convert SDRF proteomics files into pipeline configuration files.  

### ‚ö° Workflow Utilities
